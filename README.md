# Paw-Sensory-Stimuli
Correlate mouse paw sensory stimuli to S1 and M1 cortex neural firing rates.

Sensory feedback is essential for survival. 
Animals respond to environmental changes through their perceived notion of the world. Thus, 
understanding how different regions of the brain communicate to effectively adapt to environmental factors 
is important. Here we placed head-fixed and genetically modified mice (GCaMP6s x CamKII-tTa) on a wheel 
with three different textures. They were imaged using a 2-photon laser and recorded for 40 minutes. The neural 
imaging of calcium fluorescence was processed with Suite2p. The behavioral videos were processed with 
DeepLabCut. The outputs of both systems were filtered, realigned, and analyzed using python to determine
the connection between different sensory stimuli through paws and neural preference in the S1 and M1 cortex.
